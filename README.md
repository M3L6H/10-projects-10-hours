# 10 Hours 10 Projects

Inspired by [Florin Pop's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4&ab_channel=FlorinPop),
this is a challenge in which the programmer completes 10 simple web projects in
10 hours.

Although I only managed to complete nine out of the ten projects, it was a rewarding
experience, and one that I enjoyed thoroughly. I look forward to trying it again
in the future.
